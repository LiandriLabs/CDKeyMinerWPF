We will use this folder to download miner plug-ins for your hardware.

If you find this folder empty, then either we couldn't find a miner for you, or your anti-virus deleted the miner!
Note that anti-virus programs detect mining software as "potentially unwanted", even if there's nothing wrong with it.
Add this folder to your exceptions in your anti-virus, so that it leaves it alone :)
